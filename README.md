# Stardew Valley Think-n-Talk
Allows the Stardew Valley Farmer to talk

Used from the chat window:

/talk ???? - a talking bubble will appear above of the Famer.

/think ???? - a thinking bubble will appear above the Farmer.

/clear, /talk,/think - clears the speech bubble

In a multiplayer game, any players without this mod will not see the think or talk bubbles and errors will be thown by the game.  The game will function, but errors will appear for each new think or talk bubble.
